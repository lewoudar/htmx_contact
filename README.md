# Contacts App

This project is an adaptation of examples of the excellent book [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/) in
Django.

I learnt a few things in Django like how to pass form data to other methods than **POST**. Hope this will help some of
you. :)

I also use [django ninja extra](https://eadwincode.github.io/django-ninja-extra/) for the JSON API chapter. It really
simplifies the creation of APIs.
